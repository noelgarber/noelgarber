Hello! I'm Noel Garber, a PhD student in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Toronto, slated to graduate in 2023. 

I develop analytical methods and write bioinformatics programs in Python as part of my work in studying protein-protein interactions. Some of my interests include, but are not limited to: 

   - General protein sequence analysis
   - Short linear motif (SLiM) prediction with conditional weighted matrices (i.e. a matrix-of-matrices approach)
   - In vitro SPOT peptide arrays for SLiM identification
   - Machine learning approaches for SPOT array data analysis and extrapolation
   - BioID-MS (proximity proteomics) for identifying hard-to-find protein-protein interactions
   - Protein localization studies
   
In general, I'm skilled in developing with Python for data science applications and biological sequence analysis. I have competencies in general Python, BioPython, sequence processing, automated annotation, and enrichment analysis. I also have significant experiencce in wet lab cell biology methods generating the data used in the aforementioned analytical techniques. 

In parallel with my PhD, I'm completing my Certificate in Scientific Computing through SciNet HPC Consortium, which hosts the Niagara supercomputer at the University of Toronto. To date, I've taken graduate courses in Python/BioPython, CUDA GPU programming with Numba, and Apptainer/container-based computing. By June 2023, this will have expanded to include parallelization, relational databases, and most excitingly, neural network programming. I'm a very strong proponent of AI and machine learning in biological research. 

I'm always interested in collaborating on interesting bioinformatics projects, especially related to protein-protein interactions - please feel free to reach out! 

As I wrap up my PhD, I'm also very interested in both full time and freelance opportunities, and would welcome discussions with interested parties. Cheers!
