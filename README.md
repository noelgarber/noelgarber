Hello! I'm Noel Garber a PhD student in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Toronto, slated to graduate in 2023. 

I develop analytical methods and write bioinformatics programs in Python as part of my work in studying protein-protein interactions. Some of my interests include, but are not limited to: 

   - General protein sequence analysis
   - Short linear motif (SLiM) prediction with conditional weighted matrices (i.e. a matrix-of-matrices approach)
   - In vitro SPOT peptide arrays for SLiM identification
   - Machine learning approaches for SPOT array data analysis and extrapolation
   - BioID-MS (proximity proteomics) for identifying hard-to-find protein-protein interactions
   - Protein localization studies
   
In general, I'm skilled in developing with Python for data science applications and biological sequence analysis. I'm also learning other peripheral topics currently, including bash scripting and high performance Python methods. In April, I will be participating in a course on neural network programming for deep learning in scientific computing, thereby completing my Certificate in Scientific Computing from SciNet at the University of Toronto. 

I'm always interested in collaborating on interesting bioinformatics projects, with a special focus on therapeutics development - please feel free to reach out!

As I wrap up my PhD, I'm also very interested in full time opportunities, and would welcome discussions with interested parties. Cheers!
